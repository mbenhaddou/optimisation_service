we have tasks work orders spaning multiple days:
case 1: we have too many clients to serve.
Case 2 clients start date requirement does not allow to solve in one day.
general case, case 1 and 2 are present in the same time.


Algorithm

Optimisation horizon: 5 days

horizon=5
start_date = Date_0
date_i=0
workorders=[initial_workorders]
solution={}
while date_i<horizon or workorders !=[:
    work_orders=get_all_workorders(work_orders, start_date<=date_i) #add new work orders that should start  this day
    model_params=compute_time_distance(stat=date, locations, work_orers)
    solution=routing.solve(model_params)
    work_orders=solution.droped()
    solution[date_i]=solution
    date_i+=1

return solution
