- Changed: refactoring to allow for parallel processing
- Feat: add early stopping criteria
- Feat: add 'result_type' field in json. It can control the trade-off between speed and quality. It can take 3 values:
   * "fast" for quick results, using fast and heuristic strategies
   * "optimized" for better results, using the best heuristic strategies but take more time.
   * "best" gets even better results by running multiple "optimized" instances and selecting the best ones. The default number of instances per case is 4.
- Feat: add "no_improvement_limit" parameter to control early stopping. It represents the number of iteration without improvement that are permitted. The default value is 100. increase this value for better results.
Version 1.2.1
-Fixed: must_start_date and must_end_date now are working and unittest added.

-Improved: Parallelize distance and duration matrix to improve speed.
Version 1.2.3
-Fixed: raising error when using ProcessPoolExecutor due to not being able to persist python object.
Version 1.2.4
- Feat: in the shift the pause can now be optional, to allow for scheduling of workorder that are longer that a break
- Fixed: geolocation presence in worker was not taken into account.
- Changed: time_limit is now expressed in the same unit ast time_unit, changed from being expressed by default in minutes.
