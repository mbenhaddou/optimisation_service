# Introduction to Mentis Optimization Library

## Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the Mentis Optimization Library! This library is designed to offer robust, efficient solutions for two types of complex optimization problems: **Routing** and **Scheduling**. Whether you are managing a fleet of vehicles, optimizing worker assignments, or looking to improve your organization's operational efficiency, this library provides the tools you need to achieve optimized solutions.

## Features

- **Routing**: Optimize the path and sequence for a group of vehicles or workers to perform a set of tasks or deliver goods.
  
- **Scheduling**: Efficiently assign tasks to a team of workers while taking into account numerous constraints such as availability, skill set, and workload.


## Input Data

The library works with JSON-formatted input data that describe the following:

- Teams and their members
- Depots for each team
- Workers' skills, availability, and constraints
- Work orders that need to be executed, with their priority, skills required, and various time constraints
- Initial routes, global depots, and other optimization parameters

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Mentis Optimization Library, check out the [Quick Start Tutorial](./QuickStart.md).
